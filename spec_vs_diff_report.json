  "summary": "All four requirements are implemented. REQ-1 is addressed by the new registerAdminUser function in backend/main.mo with first-admin bootstrap and anonymous-caller rejection. REQ-2 is satisfied by the new frontend/src/pages/AdminRegister.tsx page with authentication check, register button, redirect on success, and error display. REQ-3 is covered by updates to frontend/src/App.tsx (adds #admin-register route, renders AdminRegister) and frontend/src/pages/AdminLogin.tsx (adds a link to #admin-register). REQ-4 is fulfilled by the useRegisterAsAdmin mutation hook in frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts. One minor gap: duplicate registration is not explicitly handled with a graceful soft error in the backend.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Duplicate registration is handled gracefully (returns an error or no-op if already admin)",
      "reason": "The registerAdminUser function in backend/main.mo does not contain an explicit check for whether the caller is already registered as admin before proceeding. No duplicate-registration guard returning a soft error or no-op is visible in the diff; the only guard is for the unauthorized case after the first admin exists.",
