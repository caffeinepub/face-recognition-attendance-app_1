  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-2 by fixing the RegisterStudent component (camera initialization, upload progress, error handling, loading states), improving error message extraction in useQueries.ts hooks, and adding a migration module. The implementation covers all five acceptance criteria: form fields for name/studentId/photo, successful backend registration, student list invalidation after registration, success/error toasts, and meaningful duplicate-ID error messages.",

    {
      "description": "A backend/migration.mo file was added that defines a no-op migration module used in main.mo via 'with migration = Migration.run'.",
      "reason": "The build request only requested fixing the student registration flow. Adding a migration module and wiring it into the actor architecture was not requested and alters the backend structure beyond what was asked.",
